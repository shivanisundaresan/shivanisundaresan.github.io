            <p>I grew up in Chantilly, VA but spent my elementary and middle school years in Bangalore. I joined <a target="_blank" href="https://umich.edu">The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> in 2021 as a pre-law student because I am passionate about social justice as well as science and technology policy related to artificial intelligence and sustainability. However, I found a passion for coding through my coursework and extracurricular involvements. I am currently double majoring in computer science and cognitive science, as it allows me to combine my passion for helping people with my love for expressing my creativity.</p>

            <p>On campus, I am the Vice President of <a href="https://www.geecsumich.com/">Girls in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a>, a student organization with over 200 active members focused on empowering women and non-binary people to pursue careers in tech. My role involves organizing professional development events with our sponsors to help our members succeed in their future careers. I am also a data visualization project manager on <a href="http://bluelab.engin.umich.edu/bluelab-metro.html">BLUElab Metro</a>, which is an engineering project team focused on socially engaged design solutions in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area. I have managed an <a href="https://analytics.a2gov.org/superset/dashboard/air-quality/">air quality visualization</a> with the carbon neutrality initiative of Ann Arbor's local government (A2Zero) as well as a <a href="https://shivanisundaresan.github.io/bluelabmetrocanopycover/">carbon sequestration visualization</a> with BLUELab Metro's Canopy Cover subteam, which works with President Ono's <a href="https://planetblue.umich.edu/campus/goals/carbonneutrality/">mission to make University of Michigan's campus carbon neutral by 2040.</a> I'm also a current member of <a href="https://www.mproduct.org/">MProduct</a> (Michigan's premier product management club) and a research group called <a href="https://www.maisi.club/">MAISI</a> (Michigan AI Safety Initiative).</p>
