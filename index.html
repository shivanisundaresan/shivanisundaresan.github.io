          <p>I grew up in Chantilly, VA but spent my elementary and middle school years in Bangalore. I joined <a
              target="_blank" href="https://umich.edu">The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> in 2021 where I found a passion for coding through my coursework and
            extracurricular involvements. I am currently double majoring in computer science and cognitive science, as
            it allows me to combine my passion for coding, math, psychology and philosophy.</p>

          <p>On campus, I am the Vice President of <a href="https://www.geecsumich.com/">Girls in Electrical

            empowering women and non-binary people to pursue careers in tech. My role involves organizing professional
            development events with our sponsors to help our members succeed in their future careers. I am also a data
            visualization project manager on <a

            project team focused on socially engaged design solutions in the Ann Arbor/Detroit area. I'm a member of <a
