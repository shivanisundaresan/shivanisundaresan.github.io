        <p>I joined <a target="blank" href="https://umich.edu">The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor</a> in 2021 as a pre-law student because I am passionate about social justice as well as science and technology policy related to artificial intelligence and sustainability. However, I found a passion for coding through my coursework and extracurricular involvements. I am currently double majoring in computer science and cognitive science, as it allows me to combine my passion for helping people with my love for expressing my creativity.</p>
